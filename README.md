# Python



### This is a python repository, including kinds of scripts arising from practice and the process of study. It records a number of useful python built-in utils, coding tricks, practical methods, ML cases and things about Data Mining, which is a customized 'python reference' for myself. Meanwhile, hope it could give you some inspiration.
