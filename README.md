# Python

### This is a python repository, including various scripts arising from practice or the process of study. It will record useful python built-in utils, some tricks, practical methods, ML cases and things about Data Mining, which is a customized 'python reference' for myself and may help me in the future. Meanwhile, you might get some inspiration from them.
